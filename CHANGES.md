- Guarded Twitter timeline and profile-image JSON parsing so missing remote
  fields do not crash the sample.
- Extended static project checks to catch forced Twitter JSON unwraps.
- Added `make check` as the shared repository verification alias.
- Restored the app and unit-test `Info.plist` files referenced by the Xcode project.
- Added a `make verify` quality gate for plist, storyboard, asset, and project contracts.
- Documented the static verification flow for non-macOS hosts.
